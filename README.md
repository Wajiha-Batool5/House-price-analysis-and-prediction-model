# 🏠 House Price Analysis and Prediction

## 📌 Overview

This project analyzes housing data, explores patterns and correlations, and builds a machine learning model to predict house prices. The workflow includes:

* Data cleaning & preprocessing
* Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
* Feature engineering
* Model training & evaluation
* Price prediction

## 📂 Project Structure

```
House Price Analysis and Prediction.ipynb  # Main Jupyter Notebook
README.md                                  # Project documentation
data/zameen.csv                            # Dataset used
```

## ⚙️ Requirements

Make sure you have the following installed:

```bash
python >= 3.8
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
jupyter
```

Install them using:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter
```

## 📊 Steps in the Notebook

1. **Load Dataset**
   Reads the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.

2. **Data Cleaning**

   * Handle missing values
   * Remove duplicates
   * Fix data types

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Statistical summaries
   * Correlation analysis
   * Data visualization (histograms, scatter plots, heatmaps)

4. **Feature Engineering**

   * Encoding categorical variables
   * Creating new features (e.g., house age, price per sqft)
   * Scaling numerical features

5. **Model Training**

   * Split data into train/test sets
   * Train different regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest)
   * Compare performance using metrics (MAE, RMSE, R²)

6. **Prediction**

   * Use trained model to predict prices for new data

7. **Model Evaluation & Conclusion**

   * Discuss performance
   * Highlight important features affecting price

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Place the dataset in the same directory as the notebook.
3. Open the notebook in Jupyter:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "House Price Analysis and Prediction.ipynb"
   ```
4. Run the cells step-by-step.

## 📈 Example Output

* **Correlation Heatmap** showing how features affect price.
* **Price Prediction Graphs** comparing actual vs predicted values.

## 📌 Notes

* Ensure the dataset format matches what the notebook expects.
* Adjust feature engineering steps if your dataset has different columns.
